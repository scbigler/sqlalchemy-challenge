# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Purpose

- Python and SQLAlcemy were used to explore the data and do temperature and precipitation analysis.
- The precipitation and temperature data was collected using monitoring stations in Hawaii and stored in a SQLite database.
- SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries were used for the analysis.
- A Flask application was created so that the climate data can be accessible via API calls.
